# Implementation Todo Checklist for Long Path Support

This checklist tracks progress on implementing long path support in pythonservice.exe according to the prompt plan.

## Prompt 1: Understanding the PythonService.cpp Structure
- [x] Analyze PythonService.cpp file structure
- [x] Identify conditional compilation macros for DLL vs EXE builds
- [x] Determine appropriate location for manifest code
- [x] Check for existing manifest or resource-related code

## Prompt 2: Creating a Test Service for Verification
- [x] Create Windows service test script
- [x] Implement long path access test
- [x] Add logging functionality
- [x] Document installation and removal process

## Prompt 3: Adding the Application Manifest to PythonService.cpp
- [x] Create #pragma comment(linker) directives
- [x] Add conditional compilation for EXE build only
- [x] Include complete manifest XML with longPathAware element
- [x] Insert code at appropriate location in file

## Prompt 3: Adding the Application Manifest to PythonService.cpp
- [ ] Create #pragma comment(linker) directives
- [ ] Add conditional compilation for EXE build only
- [ ] Include complete manifest XML with longPathAware element
- [ ] Insert code at appropriate location in file

## Prompt 4: Build Verification Process
- [ ] Document commands to build pythonservice.exe
- [ ] Provide commands to extract and examine manifest
- [ ] List verification criteria for manifest
- [ ] Document potential build issues to watch for

## Prompt 5: Testing the Implementation
- [ ] Create step-by-step testing instructions
- [ ] Document test environment setup
- [ ] Provide service installation and execution steps
- [ ] Explain result interpretation
- [ ] Include tests for both enabled and disabled registry settings

## Prompt 6: Documentation and Release Notes
- [ ] Draft CHANGES.txt entry
- [ ] Create user documentation for long path support
- [ ] Document requirements and caveats

## Prompt 7: Integration and Final Review
- [ ] Summarize all implementation changes
- [ ] Create final review checklist
- [ ] Document edge cases and compatibility considerations
- [ ] Provide final testing recommendations
