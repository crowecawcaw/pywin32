### INSTRUCTIONS: DO NOT MODIFY OR DELETE ###
Read rough-idea.md. Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this idea. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed specification I can hand off to a developer. Let's do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. Remember, only one question at a time and don't repeat questions I've already answered. Update idea-honing.md as we go to track our progress.
### END INSTRUCTIONS ###
